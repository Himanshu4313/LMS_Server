## E-Learning Platform Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the backend of our dynamic e-learning platform, powered by Node.js and Express.js, and supported by MongoDB for seamless data management.

## Technologies Used

1. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
2. Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building robust APIs.
3. MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data efficiently.

## Dependencies

 Before you start, ensure the following dependencies are installed on your machine:

1. Node.js
2. npm (Node Package Manager)
3. MongoDB

## Getting Started

```

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

Copy code
```

.
├── controllers
├── models
├── routes
├── utils
├── configs
├── uploads
├── app.js
└── server.js


```

1. controllers: Houses route handlers and business logic.
2. models: Defines MongoDB schemas.
3. routes: Specifies API routes.
4. utils: Contains utility functions.
5. configs: Contains configartion file.
6. uploads: Contain file of Image or video.
7. app.js: All pre-require things are there when server is start.
8. server.js: Entry point for the application.

## Database Schema
